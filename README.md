# Fake-Image-Detection-using-GAN-Models
Detecting fake or manipulated images in today's digital age has become increasingly challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
# Fake Image Detection

This project is a Streamlit app for detecting fake images using a trained machine learning model. It can distinguish between real and fake images uploaded by users.

## Installation

To run this Streamlit app, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-Image-Detection.git
Run the Streamlit app.
streamlit run app.py
Access the app in your web browser via the provided URL.
Model
The machine learning model used for fake image detection is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It has been trained on a dataset of real and fake images.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is not provided in this repository. You can replace it with your own dataset.
